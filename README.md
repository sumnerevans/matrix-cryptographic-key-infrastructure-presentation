# Where are my keys?

**Demystifying Matrix Cryptography**

If you've used Matrix for any period of time, you will know that Matrix has a
lot of keys. There are keys for devices, keys for users, keys for messages, keys
for the keys for messages, keys for backups, keys for the keys to the backups.
In this talk, I'm going to try to provide a framework for thinking about keys in
Matrix. I also will discuss some of the pitfalls both baked into the spec and
those which are a function of the nature of a networked protocol.
